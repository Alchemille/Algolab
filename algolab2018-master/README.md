# Algo Lab 2018
## Foreword
Hey you! If you are reading these lines, you are probably going through the
difficult times of AlgoLab whatever year you are in. This repository is all I
used and/or wrote for me to pass algolab in HS2018. AlgoLab can be a back-down-to-the-earth
experience if, like-me, you don't have much experience in competitive programing
nor c++. However, if you are ever in doubt, come back to those lines because
**you can definitely do it!**.The only and most important thing being dedication. May
this repository help you and the following students from years to come in this hard
but hopefully rewarding task.

## General Advice
### Problems of the week
In case of fall 2018, a special problem comes out every Monday and you are allocated two
hours to solve it. Make sure to try to do them as soon as them come out. It will
give you a good feeling of where you stand with the material and accustom you with
the exam conditions. It is not a big deal if you can't score points in time but if you
can't figure a PotW, try to score intermediate points! They sometimes seems trivial but
they will be crutial in the exam and you don't want to fail on the bruteforce/easier implementations.
Also study with your friends, it's going to make this whole thing way less depressing.

### General problems
They way I tackled AlgoLab was to try to stay on float with the weekly problems. I don't think
everybody needs to do that but it is rewarding to see that you have a good stand in the class
leaderboard. However, pay attention to how much time you take on an exercise. Doing it in 6 hours
the first time is ok but by the end of the semster, you should definitely be able to code it in 2
if not 1h30. Also, problems in the exam are usually variations of already seen problems. Therefore,
if you don't do all problems, be comfortable with their solutions as you might have to build upon them.

### External resources
I would really focus on the exercises that are provided as the exam builds upon them. However, if needed,
it is always good to brush up your C/C++ skills. I would also try to improve the speed at which you
can correctly and soundly code if it is not sufficient. As of the coding environement you use during
the exam, it is of course up to you but make sure you master it. I personally used this opportunity
to greatly improve my vim skills and used it during the exam.

### Exam Prep
If you're up to date with the PotW and the exercises, you're on a good track. I would advice
to redo some of the exercises but by really paying attention to the time limit
constraint as well as how fast you can code it. It is beneficial to know some useful snippets
that are likely to be useful during the exam.

### The exam
It is a two fold exams across two days separated with a week. It really worked for me to first focus
on algorithm design before touching the keyboard. You should have a specific algorithm and an
implementation plan before starting to code it. Really take your time and use some paper to do so and
do some drawings if you like with colors, use highliners and whatsoever shit you like.
After that, **REREAD THE PROBLEM**. Every another time, I would find a small detail that I had 
misinterpreted. Pay specific attention to what variables may vary and in what range. Only then start to code.
If you've played the game along the semester,you should be able to implement any of the exam problems pretty
darn quickly. I am just giving hints here, if you think you can start straight to the coding, fine, but please
try it out before the exam as it might not go as you expect in yout mind.
Also, do not despair if the first session does not go as planned. I scored 80/300 points in the first
fold but managed to keep me on float with the second session.

## This repository

- Problems and PotW

	In the weeks and PotW folder, you can find the pdfs and code of all the problems I solved during the
	semester. **PLEASE DO THEM YOURSELF BEFORE TURNING TO MY SOLUTIONS**. Even if I think I greatly
	improved my reasoning by reading other people's solutions, you should always try to solve them yourself first.
	I know this is straight-forward but still. Listen to me on this one. It's only by debuging those
	nasty old c++ libraries that you will master them to the class extent.

- Supplementary Exercises

	In this folder, I put all the exercises from past year that I could scrap from other gits.
	They might be useful but do not spend your time on them.

- AlgoLab cheatsheet

	In this tex file, I tried to sum up all of the useful snippets I gathers along the semesters.
	Some macros might be super useful especially the BGL ones that allow you to iterate super easily
	over graphs, edges, vertices, you name it. The text file is along a please feel free to augment it.

I think that's about it. Very serious README for something that I'm sure you will nail easy-peasy.
And if not, it's going to be something you will remember if you do it serously.
Good luck and peace out

___I cannot make this repository public unfortunately as I am still at ETH and the algolab team
would ask me to take it down. But if you know people for which this git would be beneficial, send
them a copy.___
